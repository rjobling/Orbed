# Orbed

To test this setup you'll need to:
- Build Orbed.sln using Visual Studio.
- Build the IntroDemo using VSCode and Bartman's plugin.
- Run IntroDemo in Winuae or VSCode.
- Run Orbed.
- With these two running you should be able to:
	- Click "Connect" in Orbed to connect to IntroDemo.
	- Click "Pause" and then adjust the parameters.
- For Rocket you need to also run the editor, there's a copy in the rocket-editor folder.
- With all three running you can now:
	- Click "Rocket Connect".
	- Make sure "Pause" is clicked.
	- Now the Rocket editor should be able to drive the parameters.
	- There's an example rocket file: intro.rocket
